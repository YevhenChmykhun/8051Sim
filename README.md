# OpenSim51
Simulator of Intel MCS-51 microcontroller (WIP)

The project does not follow the official documentation of A51 macro assembler in full nor does it implement all microcontroller instructions, therefore it can be used only as an educational tool and not as a complete and reliable implementation.

The goals of the project:
  * explore and understand how computers work at the lowest level
  * come up with a maintainable and extensible software architecture for this kind of project
 
Modules:
  * A51 macro assembler
  * MCS-51 microcontroller simulator
  * GUI
  * misc (Intel HEX parser)
 
 Used tools:
  * Java 8
  * JavaFX
  * ANTLR4
